 Round 1B explained in simple words:

Imagine you have a stack of 10 books, but you only have time to read the most important chapters for your specific goal.

**Round 1B asks you to build a "smart assistant" that does this for you.**

1.  **You give the assistant:**
    * **The Books:** A collection of 3-10 PDF documents.
    * **Who You Are:** A simple description of a person (e.g., "a student," "a doctor," "a business analyst").
    * **Your Goal:** What you want to accomplish (e.g., "study for an exam," "find the latest research," "compare company profits").

2.  **The assistant's job is to:**
    * Read through all the books.
    * Understand your goal.
    * Find the *exact sections* from all the books that are most relevant to your goal.
    * Give you back a ranked list, from "most important section" to "least important."

Essentially, you are building a tool that can read a pile of documents and intelligently pick out the most useful parts for a specific person's task.
